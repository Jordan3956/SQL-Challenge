# SQL-Challenge
This project encompasses designing and implementing a database schema to analyze historical employee data from Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. The SQL code establishes crucial tables for departments, employees, job titles, salaries, and managerial relationships, forming the basis for subsequent data analysis. The queries addressed specific questions about the employee dataset, offering insights into the company's workforce. These queries retrieve employee details, including employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary, as well as first names, last names, and hire dates for employees hired in 1986. Additional queries unveil department managers with corresponding department numbers, names, employee numbers, last names, and first names, and associate employee details with their respective department numbers and characters. The queries highlight employees with specific names or department affiliations and reveal frequency counts of employee last names to understand name distribution. Collectively, these SQL queries facilitate comprehensive data exploration and analysis, shedding light on historical workforce patterns and insights.
